                    <p>The <b>Vix</b> is the popular name for the Chicago Board Options Exchange's <b>Volatility Index</b>, 
                        a measure of the stock market's expected volatility based on S&P 500 index options. 
                        It is often referred to as the fear index or fear gauge.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The Vix signals the <b>level of fear or stress</b> in the stock market. The higher the VIX, 
                        the greater the level of fear and uncertainty in the market, with levels above 30 
                        indicating high levels of uncertainty.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The <b>S&P 500</b> is the Standard and Poor's 500 index - a stock market index tracking the stock performance of 
                        500 of the largest companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. It is one of the most 
                        commonly followed equity indices, and is the stock index often referred to generally as "the market".
                        <br/><br/>
                        Machine learning models here demonstrate how elevated levels of the Vix can help <b>predict a positive gain for the S&P 500
                        index</b> one year into the future. When the Vix rises above 35, and especially above 50, this chart shows the historical
                        return on the S&P 500 from that point to one year into the future.

                        <p style="width: 600px;">The performance of the S&P 500 is charted here from 2000-2023.
                            <br/><br/>
                            For each day, the one-year future return of the S&P 500 is plotted, with the percentage return on left (y-axis).
                            The bottom (x-axis) shows the corresponding Vix value one-year prior. When the Vix is between 35 and 50, the 
                            S&P 500 has often yielded significant positive returns over the following year. When the Vix exceeds 50, 
                            all one-year returns (except for one slight loss) were positive.

                <p>In this chart, the future returns of S&P 500 are aligned with the current value of the Vix, showing the strong 
                    positive coorelation between positive S&P 500 returns and high Vix values. For potential investors, a good time to 
                    consider investing for a one-year period in the S&P 500 would be when the Vix is above 50, but a Vix over 35 has 
                    also yielded frequent positive results.
